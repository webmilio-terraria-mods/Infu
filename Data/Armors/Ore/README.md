The classification of ore-based armors are decided based on their element's g/mol.
I.e. Fe 55.845 is lighter than Pb 207.2

The hardmore ores are probablematic as I have yet to implement a way for pieces to "follow" other pieces,
for example having the Cobalt Mask be cloth and the other pieces follow whatever headpiece you're wearing.
